# Tutorial - Tables

Here we will learn how to interact with tables, using scripts coded in JavaScript. But first, let's understand each HTML tag that makes up the structure of a table.

## HTML - Tables

There are several HTML tags related to tables. Here we have the fundamentals, found in all tables.

- `<table>`- defines the limits of the table. Inside it we will find cells, distributed in rows and columns;
- `<tr></tr>` - stands for Table Row;
- `<td></td>` - stands for Table Data. It represents the cells, and each row (`<tr>`) must have the same number of cells, because from this intersaction (rows and cells) we will have the table columns. Inside a cell we can code all sorts of HTML elements, like lists, images, texts and even other tables.

Other elements are:

- `<th>` Defines a header cell in a table;
- `<caption>` - defines a table caption;
- `<colgroup>` - specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting;
- `<col>` - specifies column properties for each column within a `<colgroup>` element;
- `<thead>` - groups the header content in a table;
- `<tbody>` - is used in conjunction with the `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` elements to specify each part of a table (body, header, footer). Browsers can use these elements to enable scrolling of the table body independently of the header and footer. Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page;  
- `<tfoot>` - groups the footer content in a table.
